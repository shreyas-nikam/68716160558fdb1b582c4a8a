In this lab, we will explore Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and their application in operational risk management. This application allows you to simulate KRI data, set thresholds, and analyze the aggregated risk status across different business units. You can also explore the descriptions of standard KRI data fields.

**Key Features:**
- **KRI Configuration**: Select predefined KRIs and set custom Amber and Red alert thresholds.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Simulate time-series data for selected KRIs across multiple business locations, including underlying operational metrics.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize KRI trends over time, highlighting threshold breaches, and examine relationships between compounded KRIs.
- **Aggregated KRI View**: Provides a consolidated view of KRI statuses (Green, Amber, Red) across business units, using an aggregated comparison.
- **KRI Data Fields Exploration**: An interactive table displaying descriptions of standard KRI data fields.
